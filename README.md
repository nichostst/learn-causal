Trying to implement stuffs I learned about causal inference

Directories:
1. 'rhc' contains study on Right Heart Catheterization effect on patient death rate. Explores matching and IPTW to achieve covariate balance.
2. 'proximity' contains study on how proximity to college may affect wages, as an instrumental variable to quantity of education received. Binarization of treatment variable (education) allows the effect of treatment to be assessed.

NBViewer available here:
1. [Right Heart Catheterization](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nichostst/learn-causal/blob/master/rhc/main.ipynb)
2. [Proximity to College vs Wage](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nichostst/learn-causal/blob/master/proximity/main.ipynb)
